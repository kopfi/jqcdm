	<p>This package contains a simple framework for creating and parsing
	Qualcomm DIAG protocoll messages. This is a proprietary protocol developed
	and owned by Qualcomm. Therefore this framework may only
	support a small subset of the whole range of this protocol.</p>
	
	<p>The scope of this small framework is less on how to connect to a
	specific device rather than on how to correctly form the message to be
	send over the link. Yet still it comes with some optional commandline
	tools that can be used activly send /receive QCDM message.</p>
	
	<h3>Where to start?<h3>
	<p>The main concept of the framework is, to create an Instance of the
	interface QcdmMessage and use it to build your message and
	encapsulate it correctly. A good point to start would be, to have a look
	at the diffrent implementations of QcdmMessage. The most straight
	forward implementation is SimpleMessage. It allows to specify
	a message body by given a byte array.</p>
	
	<h3>Licensing</h3>
	<p>The jqcdm Java Library is a framework to easily create valid
	Qualcomm DIAG protocoll messages in Java programming language.<br/>
